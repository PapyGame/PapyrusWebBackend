=== How to open / edit Papyrus Custom Nodes Model without errors

To define new Papyrus custom nodes we need to reference elements from the Sirius components view model.
Therefore there are dependencies inside the Papyrus custom nodes model (located in src/main/resources/model) to two sirius components models:

- sirius-components-view/src/main/resources/model/view.ecore
- sirius-components-view-diagram/src/main/resources/model/diagram.ecore

In order to open or edit the Papyrus custom node model, you need to import at least the following sirius-components packages:

- sirius-components/packages/view/backend/sirius-components-view
- sirius-components/packages/view/backend/sirius-components-view-diagram

WARNING: Those two packages are mandatory for editing/seeing the Papyrus custom nodes model but they are not sufficient to launch the Papyrus web server application. You need all other sirius-components packages to avoid partial classes definition.
